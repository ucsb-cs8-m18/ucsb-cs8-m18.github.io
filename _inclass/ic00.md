<li markdown="1">  Please look over the instructions for [lab01](/lab/lab01), and parts 02, 03 and 04 of this tutorial:
at <https://ucsb-cs8.github.io/tutorials/turtle_letters/> Then make similar diagrams for the letters that make up the initials
of your first and last name, and the digits that make up your graduation year.
An example for the letter 'A' is shown below.

Have a TA or instructor review your work.  Then you can use it as a basis to code your solution to lab01.   There are more grids on the back, and more than you will need (in case you spoil one of them and need to start over.)

The Page Two Fine Print:

* If a letter or digit is repeated, you only need to draw the diagram once.
* If the letter 'A' is one of your initials, you don't have to do it, unless you want to make the 'A' in a different style than mine.
* If you have multiple options, e.g. you go by both Xiaohe and Holly,
you may use either X or H, as you prefer&mdash;Elizabeth or Liz may
use either E or L, etc.)
