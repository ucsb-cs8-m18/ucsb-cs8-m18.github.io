=======================================

- The Shakespeare text prediction program works now!
- local vs. global
  - variables defined inside a function are called *local*
    variables. They don't affect any variables defined with the same
    name elsewhere. This is good for encapsulation.
  - different functions have different *spaces* for variables. These
    are called namespaces.
  - a new namespace is made for every function call (example on
    p. 208)
  - *global* variables are those defined outside of any function
    - they can be accessed anywhere, but you need to use special code
      to update them inside of functions
- a very quick taste of recursion (more to come tomorrow)
- ic01!
- stacks, push and pop (starts at __main__)
