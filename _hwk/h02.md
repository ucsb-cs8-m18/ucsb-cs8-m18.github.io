<li markdown="1">  As discussed in Section&nbsp;2.4, the `type()` function returns the type of a Python value.
When you pass a variable such as `x`, `type(x)` returns the type of the value that the variable `x` currently refers to.

Assume that the following assignment statement has been executed:

```
schools=["UCSB","Stanford","UCSD","Cal Poly"]
```

What will each of the expressions below evaluate to?  As a reminder, strictly speaking, Python will print types in the format `<class 'int'>`, `<class 'float'>`, `<class 'str'>`, etc. so *please use exactly that format* for full credit.

(10 pts) Assume that `cases` is the name of a variable with a `float` value that you want to convert to an integer value.    Write a Python expression that converts `cases` to an integer (throwing away any fractional part)
</li>



<li style="margin-bottom: 4em;" markdown="1"> (10 pts) Assume that `courseNum` is an integer that represents the numeric part of a course number (e.g. 3, 8, 130, 16, 24).    Write a Python expression that converts `courseNum` to an string (i.e. `<class 'str'>` in Python)
</li>


<li style="margin-bottom: 4em;" markdown="1"> (10 pts) If you want to check whether x is greater than 10, and y is greater than 5, you can write the Python expression

```python
(x > 10) and (y > 5)
```

If `x` has the value `20`, and `y` has the value `17`, this evaluates to `True`.

But what if we accidentally wrote it as:

```python
(x > 10) + (y > 5)
```

What would this expression evaluate to, assuming the same values for `x` and `y`)?  (The answer requires you to read the section carefully, and then apply what you have learned.    I suggest you try that first before trying it at the Python command line.)

</li>

<li>Both Sections 2.4 and 2.5 mention a type of function that is called a <em>constructor</em>.

(5 pts) <em>Before</em> using the constructor for a `Fraction` object, a particular line of Python code must be written.  What is that line of code?  (Be very careful about spelling and upper vs. lower case.)

(10 pts) Assuming that line of code has been typed (the one mentioned in the previous question), how do you create a `Fraction` object that holds the fraction $$\frac{4}{5}$$ (i.e., "four&nbsp;fifths"), and makes the variable `ratio` refer to that object?

<li style="margin-bottom: 4em;" markdown="1"> (10 pts) Section 3.1 discusses a feature of IDLE called "restarting the shell".   What does the book say happens when you restart the shell?
</li>




<li style="margin-bottom: 4em;" markdown="1">
(10 pts) Section 3.1 also discusses the `input()` function,
which is used to get input from the user.   It indicates that the result
of the `input()` function always comes back as a particular data type,
no matter what the user types in.   What is this data type?


</li>

<li style="margin-bottom: 4em;" markdown="1"> Section 3.2 discusses the fact that you can <em>nest</em> control structures in Python.

<ol>
<li style="margin-bottom: 6em;" markdown="1"> (10 pts) What does it mean to <em>nest</em> control structures in Python?

(Note: you won't find the answer spelled out in the text.  It is implied, but not clearly explained.  So you'll have to do some thinking to figure out how to answer.  That's on purpose.)
</li>


<li style="margin-bottom: 4em;" markdown="1"> (10 pts) What can you see in the Python code (or do you have to write in your own Python code) to indicate that something is "nested"?  (This is also in the text, but implied rather than stated.)
</li>
</ol>

<div class="pagebreak">
</div>

</li>


<li style="margin-bottom: 3em;" markdown="1"> (10 pts)
Section 3.2 discusses iteration, which means doing things over and over again,
in a loop.  As we will learn, there is more than one kind of loop in Python,
but there is a particular kind of loop discussed in Section 3.2 that allows us to process each character in a string, or each item in a list, one at a time.

What is the Python word that starts that kind of loop? 


</li>



<li markdown="1" style="margin-bottom:4em;"> (10 pts) On p. 56-57, the textbook suggests using the `eval()` function
to convert the result of `input()` from the user if it going to be used
as something other than a string (e.g. as a number, list, etc.)

THIS IS A POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS HABIT TO GET INTO.  DON'T DO IT.

(We'll discuss this in more detail in lecture, but the short version
is: this is the kind of habit that leaves security vulnerabilities
open for hackers.    There isn't any real danger in an intro course,
because the software you write won't be run by anyone except you and your
TA, but in general, this is VERY bad habit to get into.)

So what can we do instead?  Well, you actually already saw one option&mdash;a technique that was discussed in Section 2.4.   Suppose we have this Python
statement:

<div style="width:65%" markdown="1">
```
ageAsString = input('Please enter your age in years: ')
```
</div>

Using techniques from Section 2.4, but NOT using `eval`, what line
of Python code can you write to convert
the value `ageAsString` into an `int` value?

</li>

<li style="margin-bottom: 0.1em;" markdown="1"> (20 pts) Read about the `if` and `else` statements in Section 3.2, including what happens when the various programs in Section 3.2 are run.

(If you want to run them yourself to see what happens, I strongly encourage that!  And: it is ok to type them in and run them, even including the `eval` function calls; I don't want to scare you too much about that. The  `eval` function is only risky when someone you don't trust is putting input into your code, e.g. when you are making a app that the general public will use.)

Once you think you understand how `if` and `else` works, consider this code, which is incomplete.   Add the code that is needed so that if the user puts in something other than `CA` for the state, the code will print "Out of State Tuition".   Be sure to indent your code properly, and include all needed punctuation.

<div style="font-size:144%" markdown="1">
```
homeState = input("Please enter your state: ")

if homeState=="CA":
  print("In State Tuition")

```
</div>

</li>

<li markdown="1"> (10 pts) Section 3.2 discusses how to use the `range` function with a loop
so that you can cause a variable to take on a sequence of values&mdash;the sample code illustrates this by printing those values. (Later we'll do other things with those sequences of values such as adding them, or multiplying them, or using them to index into a list or string, or to draw things.)

<li markdown="1" style="margin-botton:0em"> (20 pts) Page 68 lists this Python function definition that corresponds to the mathematical function $$ f(x) = x^2 + 1 $$

{% highlight python linenos %}
def f(x):
   res = x**2 + 1
   return res
{% endhighlight %}

Note that we can also write this more simply without the `res` variable, saving a line of code.    
{% highlight python linenos %}
def f(x):
   return x**2 + 1
{% endhighlight %}

Which version is better? That's a matter of <em>programming style</em>.  Often, but not always, writing in fewer lines of code is preferred.  With experience, you'll gain a sense of when to do one vs. the other.   For this problem, it is up to you which option to use.

In the space below, please write a function definition for the mathematical function $$ g(x) = 2x^2 - 3x + 4 $$

<li>  The following is a <em>function definition</em>.  Note that `def` is an abbreviation for definition:

Contrast this with a function call such as `f(3)`, `f(2 + 2)`, or `f(0.5)`.   Those evaluate to `10`, `17`, and `1.25` respectively.
